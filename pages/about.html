    <hr><p>This website was made in march 2024 after someone challenged me to create something using Marvel API. I did not know how to use APIs in general back than but I accepted it anyways.
    </br>It had a lot of fun while making this site a thing and I hope you had at least a glimpse of joy from staring at these pixels.
